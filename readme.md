## Hosting

The API is hosted on https://priyanshu-vyas-weather-api.onrender.com
(PS: It sometimes doesn't give the forecast data and send the error response instead, since it is a free hosting service. The works fine in localhost tho..)

## Postman Collection

Here is the postman collection: https://www.postman.com/priyanshu01/workspace/priyanshuvyas/example/20534179-650f1980-902e-4980-81e7-a04cb4c5e7bd
